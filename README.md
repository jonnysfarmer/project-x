# Project-x - Beer
## Overview
Our task was to produce our first multi page website using purely REACT over a weekend.
I choose to use a Brewdog (craft beer) API and to and give you the ability to search and find your favourite brewdog beer and give you information about it from both a drinking and brewing perspecitive.

Launch on [GitHub Pages](https://jonnysfarmer.github.io/project-x/).  Check out the GitHub [Repo](https://github.com/jonnysfarmer/project-x)
