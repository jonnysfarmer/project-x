# Project-X - Beer
## Overview
Our task was to produce our first multi page website using purely REACT over a weekend.
I choose to use a Brewdog (craft beer) API and to and give you the ability to search and find your favourite brewdog beer and give you information about it from both a drinking and brewing perspecitive.

Launch on [GitHub Pages](https://jonnysfarmer.github.io/project-x/).  Check out the GitHub [Repo](https://github.com/jonnysfarmer/project-x)

## Technologies used
* React
* Webpack
* Scss
* JavaScript (ES6)
* GitHub Pages
* Google Fonts
* axios
* Bulma
* react-router
* recharts

## Outcome
Overall, I am happy with my first multi plage React website.  I like the filtering function, showing the results until there is only one left.  I also used recharts for the first time showing the hop values which I am pleased with.  I am looking forward to using more libraries in the future.  I think the basic nature of this api meant I could only do so much, but looking forward to using my complex APIs in the future.

## Challenges
This was the first time I used recharts and react-router.  I also concentrated on using Bulma as much as possible to make it mobile native.  It was one of my first projects for using Scss as well which took some getting used too whilst using the Bulma framework.
